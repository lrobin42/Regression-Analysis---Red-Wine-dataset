## Project Goal

We'd like to approach analysis from the perspective of wanting to ascertain what determines whether or not a wine is good quality, and also what characteristics contribute to a wine being more alcoholic than others, in order to inform wine producers of what the general market prefers. 

## Project Approach

This project uses the [Red Wine Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/data) from Kaggle to train and test multiple linear regression models and logistic regression models to predict whether or not a wine will be deemed high quality based on its features, and also what wine features contribute to higher alcohol content. 
From there, recommendations to wine producers are given, and ideas for further reason and further model improvements are given.
